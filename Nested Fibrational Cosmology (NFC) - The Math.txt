Nested Fibrational Cosmology (NFC) is rigorously defined by a hierarchical mathematical structure of nested fiber bundles, formally expressed as:
\[
E \xrightarrow{p_2} B \xrightarrow{p_1} M,
\]
where each projection map $p_i$ represents a surjective submersion. Here, $M$ is the four-dimensional Lorentzian manifold representing spacetime, $B$ is an intermediate fiber space, and $E$ represents an internal fibered structure.

The unified field \( \Psi: M \times X^9 \to \mathbb{C} \) is defined over spacetime and the internal manifold \(X^9\), which typically takes the form \( S^8 \times S^1 \). This internal structure allows for nontrivial topological features governed by homotopy groups such as:
\[
\pi_n(S^m) \quad \text{and} \quad \pi_3(S^2) \cong \mathbb{Z},
\]
which classify stable topological solitons (Hopfions).

The dynamics of NFC arise from the master action:
\[
S = \int_M d^4x \sqrt{-g}\left(\frac{R}{2\kappa} + \mathcal{L}_\Psi\right),
\]
where \(R\) is the Ricci scalar of spacetime, \(\kappa=8\pi G\), and \(\mathcal{L}_\Psi\) encapsulates kinetic and potential terms involving both spacetime and internal derivatives of \(\Psi\). The full field equations are:
\[
G_{\mu\nu}[g] = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}[\Psi], \quad (\Box_g + \Delta_h)\Psi = \frac{\partial V}{\partial \Psi^*},
\]
where \(G_{\mu\nu}\) is Einsteinâ€™s tensor, \(T_{\mu\nu}\) is the stress-energy tensor of the field \(\Psi\), \(\Box_g\) is the spacetime d'Alembertian, and \(\Delta_h\) is the internal Laplacian operator.

Mass and gauge fields emerge naturally through internal eigenvalue equations:
\[
\Delta_h Y_n = -\lambda_n Y_n, \quad m_n^2 = m_0^2 + \lambda_n,
\]
where eigenvalues \(\lambda_n\) determine the masses of particles. Gauge fields correspond to connections:
\[
F_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu + [A_\mu, A_\nu].
\]

Thus, NFC provides a mathematically consistent theory wherein physical phenomena, from fundamental particles to cosmic inflation, are emergent from the rigorous topological and geometric structure of nested fibrations.
