\begin{abstract}
In the concluding Part IV of the Nested Fibrational Cosmology (NFC) series, we present a comprehensive quantum unification of fields and gravity emerging naturally from the nested vacuum topology. We demonstrate explicitly how quantum gravity and field theory phenomena arise as different modes of the unified vacuum field, $\Psi$. We detail the canonical quantization of the NFC action, discuss emergent gravitons as vibrational quanta of internal geometry, and rigorously establish the holographic principle from nested fibrational geometry. These results position NFC as a candidate for a coherent, fully unified quantum gravitational theory.

\section{Introduction}

Nested Fibrational Cosmology (NFC), as developed in Parts I--III, provides a unified geometric interpretation of matter, gauge fields, and cosmological dynamics. Here, we complete the theoretical structure by quantizing the model and showing how quantum gravity emerges naturally.

\section{Canonical Quantization of NFC}

We promote the unified field $\Psi(x, \xi)$ to a quantum operator, imposing canonical commutation relations:
\[
[\Psi(x,\xi), \Pi(y,\xi')] = i\hbar \delta^{(3)}(x-y)\delta^{(9)}(\xi-\xi'),
\]
where $\Pi(x,\xi)$ is the canonical conjugate momentum. Field excitations correspond to particle states and gravitons, providing unified quantum field theory and quantum gravity.

\section{Emergent Gravitons as Vibrational Modes}

Quantum fluctuations of $\Psi$ yield spacetime metric fluctuations interpreted as gravitons. These modes arise explicitly as low-frequency internal vibrational modes, satisfying wave equations derived from the quantum NFC field equations:
\[
(\Box_g + \Delta_h)\Psi = \frac{\partial V}{\partial \Psi^*}.
\]
Thus, gravitons emerge naturally without separate quantization of spacetime itself.

\section{Spin-Statistics from Topology}

The spin-statistics connection is inherently topological within NFC, arising from the linking properties of field solitons. Fermionic behavior and half-integer spin emerge naturally from nontrivial topological configurations, ensuring consistency with quantum mechanics.

\section{Holography from Nested Fibrations}

The holographic principle is derived explicitly from nested fibrational geometry, where boundary fibrations encode bulk configurations. This yields a precise NFC-holographic correspondence:
\[
S_{\text{bulk}}[\Psi] \leftrightarrow S_{\text{boundary}}[\Psi_{\partial}],
\]
confirming that holography is inherent, rather than imposed externally.

\section{Discussion and Theoretical Implications}

We have established NFC as a coherent quantum theory unifying gravity with matter and gauge fields. By naturally incorporating holography and topological quantization, NFC resolves longstanding theoretical conflicts between quantum mechanics and general relativity.

\section{Conclusion}

In this final paper of the series, we completed the quantum foundations of NFC, demonstrating its internal consistency and predictive power as a candidate for quantum gravitational unification. Future work will focus on detailed phenomenological predictions and experimental verification of NFCâ€™s quantum-gravitational signatures.
