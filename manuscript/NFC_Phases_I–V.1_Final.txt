NESTED FIBRATIONAL COSMOLOGY
A Constraint-First Structural Framework with Minimal Phenomenological Contact

Author: Evan Thomas Kotler
Version: Frozen through Phase V.1
Status: Phase V beyond V.1 is Work in Progress (excluded)

ABSTRACT
Nested Fibrational Cosmology (NFC) is a structural framework formalizing a sharp asymmetry
between a dynamically protected backbone and an unprotected halo in which all emergence,
dissipation, and complexity reside. The framework is defined not by generative power but by
explicit prohibitions: backreaction, autonomous novelty, infinite regime landscapes, and
derivative bypass mechanisms are excluded by construction.

Phases I–IV establish existence, linear stability, admissible coupling (PASS), constrained
emergence, and a complete catalog of failure modes, demonstrating that the framework is
maximally brittle rather than adaptable. Phase V introduces phenomenology only under strict
constitutional guardrails. In this manuscript, phenomenological contact is limited to Phase V.1,
which provides a single bound-type exclusion result using one concrete witness system.

No explanatory, predictive, or cosmological claims are made. This manuscript presents NFC in
its fully stabilized, indexed, and falsifiable form.

READER’S GUIDE AND SCOPE DECLARATION

This paper is organized as a constraint ladder. Each phase forbids additional classes of behavior.
All quantitative claims are tied to explicitly numbered equations. Prose carries no independent force.

This paper does not claim that NFC is a Theory of Everything, a cosmological model, or a source
of physical law generation. Phase V beyond V.1 is intentionally excluded.

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE I — EXISTENCE, STABILITY, AND ADMISSIBLE COUPLING

(I.1-1) Existence witness:
∃ H_P ≠ {0}

(I.2-1) Protected dynamics:
dψ/dt = Ωψ,  Ω^T = −Ω

(I.2-2) Norm invariance:
d|ψ|^2/dt = 0

(I.3-1) Uniform gap:
Re σ(L) ≤ −γ

(I.4-1) Defect-only coupling (PASS):
C = E ∘ (ρ_v − ρ_s) ∘ J

(I.4-2) Free-channel exclusion:
J_c = 0

(I.4-3) Locking null:
ρ_v = ρ_s ⇒ C = 0

(I.5-1) No backreaction:
∂H_backbone / ∂H_halo = 0

(I.5-2) No derivative bypass:
Exact locking eliminates all dt / connection terms

(I.6-1) Non-landscape selection:
Finite admissible protected classes on compact domains

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE II — CAPACITY AND CONSTRAINED EMERGENCE

(II.1-1) Zero capacity of protected sector:
C(H_P) = 0

(II.2-1) Localization of emergence:
Emergence ⊂ H_halo

(II.3-1) Finite regime alphabet:
|R(Ω)| < ∞ for compact Ω

(II.4-1) Robust regime selection:
Attractors persist on open parameter sets

(II.5-1) No autonomous novelty:
dI_backbone/dt = 0

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE III — STRUCTURAL WITNESSES

(III.A-1) Protected subspace invariance (quantum):
L_env | H_P = 0

(III.A-2) Witness gap condition:
Re σ(L_env | H_L) ≤ −γ

(III.A-3) Defect operator:
K(t) = Π_L L_env(t) Π_P

(III.B-1) Classical backbone–halo split:
dx/dt = f_cons(x) + ε f_diss(x,t)

(III.B-2) Regime selection:
x(t) → R_i on open sets

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE IV — NECESSITY, MAXIMALITY, AND COLLAPSE

(IV.1-1) PASS necessity:
∂H_backbone / ∂H_halo = 0

(IV.2-1) Finite regime bound:
|R(Ω)| < ∞

(IV.2-2) Bounded hierarchy depth

(IV.3-1) Backreaction collapse:
Any persistent backreaction ⇒ collapse

(IV.3-2) Infinite alphabet collapse:
|R| = ∞ ⇒ loss of explanatory power

(IV.3-3) Approximate PASS failure:
Accumulated violation ⇒ delayed collapse

------------------------------------------------------------

PHASE V — MINIMAL PHENOMENOLOGY (V.1 ONLY)

(V.1-1) Adiabatic control functional:
D(T) = (κ²/γ) ∫ δ(t)² dt

(V.1-2) Leakage bound:
P_leak(T) ≤ C₁ e^(−γT) + C₂ ∫ e^(−γ(T−t)) δ(t) dt

(V.1-3) Protected drift bound:
Δ_protected(T) ≤ (C₃/γ) ∫ δ(t)² dt

Phase V beyond V.1 is excluded and remains a work in progress.

------------------------------------------------------------

APPENDIX — NON-CLAIMS

This framework does not:
• explain cosmological initial conditions
• predict particles or constants
• generate physical laws
• assert universality

Violation of any hard constraint collapses the framework.
