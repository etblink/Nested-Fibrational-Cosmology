\begin{abstract}
Part III of the Nested Fibrational Cosmology (NFC) series explores the cosmological dynamics emerging naturally from the vacuum fibration structure introduced in Parts I and II. We rigorously detail the cosmological scenario involving vacuum cavitation, leading to bubble nucleation and subsequent inflation driven by transitions within the internal fibrational topology. We explicitly derive primordial fluctuations, predict distinctive gravitational wave signatures, and identify potential candidates for dark matter and dark energy as stable topological relics. These predictions offer a robust pathway for observational verification of NFC through gravitational wave astronomy and cosmic microwave background measurements.

\section{Introduction}

Nested Fibrational Cosmology (NFC), developed in earlier papers of this series, offers a coherent theoretical framework where matter and gauge fields emerge from the underlying vacuum topology. Here, we demonstrate that this structure naturally leads to a detailed cosmological scenario with testable observational predictions.

\section{Vacuum Cavitation and Bubble Nucleation}

We start with a symmetric, metastable vacuum configuration of the internal fibration. Quantum tunneling processes allow for the nucleation of true vacuum bubbles described by instanton solutions (Coleman-De Luccia formalism):
\[
\Gamma \sim A e^{-S_E/\hbar},
\]
where $S_E$ is the Euclidean action for bubble nucleation. These $S^8$ bubble cavitations expand rapidly, forming the initial conditions of our observable universe.

\section{Inflationary Dynamics}

Bubble interiors undergo exponential inflation driven by the vacuum energy difference:
\[
V_{\text{eff}}(\Psi) = V(\Psi_0) - V(\Psi_{\text{true}}),
\]
with inflationary dynamics described by effective Friedmann equations derived from NFC field equations:
\[
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}V_{\text{eff}}(\Psi).
\]
Inflation naturally ends as the internal fiber structure relaxes to a lower-energy state.

\section{Primordial Fluctuations}

Quantum fluctuations of the unified field $\Psi$ during inflation produce curvature perturbations, leading to the observed anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):
\[
\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k) \sim \frac{H^2}{\dot{\Psi}^2},
\]
where the power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ closely matches observed near-scale invariance with slight red tilt.

\section{Gravitational Wave Signatures}

Distinctive gravitational wave signals arise from bubble collisions and vacuum topology transitions. The stochastic gravitational wave background has characteristic peaks and a slight red tilt:
\[
\Omega_{\text{GW}}(f) \sim f^{-n}, \quad n \approx 1.
\]
These signatures are detectable by future gravitational-wave observatories, providing direct tests of NFC.

\section{Dark Matter and Dark Energy from Topological Relics}

Stable solitons and defects in the vacuum topology survive inflation and provide natural dark matter candidates, characterized by mass scales set by internal eigenmodes. Residual vacuum energy and curvature of the internal fibrational geometry explain dark energy dynamics, causing late-time cosmic acceleration.

\section{Conclusion}

We have rigorously demonstrated that NFC provides a comprehensive cosmological framework, naturally explaining inflation, structure formation, dark matter, and dark energy through topological and geometrical mechanisms. The predicted gravitational wave and CMB signatures offer clear observational pathways for testing NFC in the near future. In Part IV, we will explore quantum unification and holographic aspects, completing the theoretical foundations of NFC.
