REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

Reproduction of NFC refers to logical and structural verification.

To reproduce the claims of this framework, an independent reader should:
1. Verify that all conclusions follow from explicitly numbered equations.
2. Confirm that no phase introduces unstated assumptions.
3. Check that phenomenology is limited to bound-type exclusions.
4. Confirm that all failure modes are explicit and binary.

Empirical validation, model fitting, or cosmological interpretation
are explicitly out of scope.
