# Nested Fibrational Cosmology (NFC)

**Nested Fibrational Cosmology (NFC)** is a speculative theoretical framework proposing that physical reality emerges from a deeper, higher-dimensional geometric structure organized as *nested fiber bundles*. In this view, spacetime, matter, forces, and cosmological dynamics are not fundamental entities, but emergent projections of an underlying fibrational vacuum.

This repository is a **research archive and manuscript workspace**, not a software package.

## Repository Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Present a **coherent geometric framework** for emergent spacetime and physics
- Organize a large body of conceptual, mathematical, and explanatory material
- Preserve provenance, scope boundaries, and internal consistency
- Support long-form theoretical development prior to any experimental claims

It is **not** intended to:
- Replace established physical theories
- Claim experimental verification
- Serve as an implementation or simulation toolkit
- Promote metaphysical or technological conclusions

## Core Ideas (High-Level)

At its core, NFC proposes that:

- Reality originates from a **high-dimensional vacuum manifold** (often described as 9D)
- This manifold is structured as **nested fibrations**
- Observable **3+1D spacetime** is an emergent, stable projection
- **Matter** corresponds to locked eigenmodes of the geometry
- **Forces** arise from geometric constraints rather than fundamental fields
- **Time** emerges as an ordering of fibrational reconfigurations
- **Cosmological evolution** is a phase-transition process, not a singularity

All claims are framed as *structural and ontological proposals*, not empirical assertions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is intentionally document-centric and organized by role:

### 📘 Core Manuscripts
- **NFC – current**  
  The most up-to-date unified narrative of the framework.
- **NFC – Master Manuscript – One File (PDF)**  
  Consolidated long-form presentation.

### 🧭 Orientation & Governance
- **Canonical Map**  
  Required reading. Explains how the repository fits together and how claims should be interpreted.
- **SCOPE_AND_NON_CLAIMS.md**  
  Explicit boundaries of what NFC does and does not assert.
- **PROVENANCE.txt**  
  Authorship and development history.
- **REPRODUCIBILITY.md**  
  Clarifies the current non-empirical status of the work.

### 📄 Phase Papers
- **Paper I – VI**  
  Modular development of the framework:
  - Ontology and geometry
  - Cosmological dynamics
  - Matter and interaction structure
  - Extensions and speculative domains

Later phases **do not retroactively justify earlier ones**.

### 🧮 Mathematical References
- Equation crosswalks
- Mathematical appendices
- Structural consistency documents

These materials serve as **constraints and formal support**, not predictive engines.
