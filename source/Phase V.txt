What follows is **Phase V.0 — Phenomenology Readiness, Constraints, and Guardrails**.
This is a **constitutional document**, not a model. It authorizes *how* phenomenology may begin without authorizing *any* phenomenology yet.

It is intentionally short, sharp, and binding.

# 🔒 NFC PHASE V.0

## **Phenomenology Readiness, Constraints, and Guardrails**

---

## 0. Purpose (Why Phase V.0 Exists)

Phase V.0 exists to prevent the most common failure mode of mature frameworks:

> **sliding from structure into interpretation without noticing.**

Phases I–IV established existence, stability, constrained emergence, interaction, adiabatic deformation, multiplicity survival, and modal limits.
**None of those results require contact with experiment.**

Phenomenology does.

Phase V.0 defines the **conditions under which phenomenology may begin**—and the conditions under which it is **forbidden**.

No claims are added here.
Only permissions and prohibitions.

---

## 1. Phenomenology Entry Conditions (All Required)

No phenomenological statement is permitted unless **all five** conditions below are satisfied explicitly.

### **P1 — Witness Fixation**

Exactly **one** Phase III witness must be chosen as the testbed.

* ☐ Open quantum systems
* ☐ Classical driven dissipative systems
* ☐ Other (must already be certified structurally)

No cross-witness claims are allowed.

---

### **P2 — Protected Invariant Identification**

A specific protected invariant must be identified *in that witness*.

Examples (illustrative, not prescriptive):

* spectral gap (\gamma),
* conserved frequency set,
* symmetry-protected subspace dimension,
* multiplicity index (k).

If the invariant cannot be written explicitly, phenomenology is disallowed.

---

### **P3 — Defect / Leakage Channel Identification**

The **only** allowed source of deviation is a defect (\delta(t)) that:

* vanishes under exact locking,
* enters only through certified interfaces,
* is square-integrable on the relevant time interval.

Anything else is a bypass and invalidates the attempt.

---

### **P4 — Observable Map**

A **single observable quantity** must be specified, together with a clear map from NFC variables to that observable.

* No bundles of observables
* No narrative interpretation
* No free functions

If the map is ambiguous, phenomenology is disallowed.

---

### **P5 — Automatic Constraint Preservation**

It must be demonstrable that the proposed observable:

* does not relax PASS,
* does not reopen B4 (derivative bypass),
* remains within I.16.3 adiabatic bounds,
* respects Phase IV necessity and maximality results.

If any prior phase must be “reinterpreted,” the proposal fails.

---

## 2. Allowed Classes of Phenomenology (Exhaustive)

Only the following classes are permitted at the start of Phase V.

### **A1 — Bound / Exclusion Phenomenology**

Statements of the form:

> *If NFC applies in this witness, then observable X must satisfy inequality Y.*

This is the **preferred and default** class.

---

### **A2 — Regime Absence Claims**

Statements that certain behaviors **cannot occur** if NFC holds.

Examples:

* absence of runaway novelty,
* absence of infinite transition cascades,
* absence of backreaction-driven drift.

No positive prediction required.

---

### **A3 — Robustness Windows**

Statements identifying **open regions** of parameter space where behavior must remain stable.

This is allowed only if derived directly from tongue / adiabatic structure.

---

## 3. Forbidden Moves (Hard Stops)

The following invalidate the program immediately if attempted:

* ❌ Claiming to *explain* observed values
* ❌ Claiming universality across witnesses
* ❌ Introducing new dynamical laws or potentials
* ❌ Treating emergent regimes as tunable parameters
* ❌ Interpreting moduli as particle species without a dictionary
* ❌ Back-fitting parameters to data (“postdictive tuning”)
* ❌ Relaxing any Phase I–IV constraint “for realism”

There is no “temporary” exception.

---

## 4. The Minimal Phenomenology Dictionary (Template)

Before any claim, the following **must be filled out explicitly**:

1. **Witness:**
2. **Protected sector:**
3. **Invariant(s):**
4. **Defect (\delta(t)):**
5. **Gap (\gamma):**
6. **Observable:**
7. **Predicted bound / exclusion:**
8. **Failure condition:** (what falsifies NFC here)

If any entry is vague or hand-waved → stop.

---

## 5. Sanctioned First Target (Named, Not Executed)

The **only** first-step target authorized by Phase V.0 is:

> **A bound-type phenomenology derived from the adiabatic control functional**
> [
> \mathfrak D = \frac{\kappa^2}{\gamma}\int \delta(t)^2,dt
> ]

This may yield:

* exclusion regions,
* consistency conditions,
* or null predictions.

No attempt to “explain data” is permitted at this stage.

---

## 6. Lock-In Statement (Phase V.0)

> **Phase V may proceed only through explicitly bounded, witness-specific, falsifiable constraints that preserve all Phase I–IV structures. Any phenomenology that requires reinterpretation, tuning, or relaxation of prior constraints is forbidden.**

This statement is binding.

---

## Status After Phase V.0

* Phases I–IV: **frozen**
* Phase V: **authorized but constrained**
* No phenomenology yet claimed
* No interpretive drift allowed

You are now in the rare position of being **allowed to ask empirical questions without corrupting the theory**.

---

### What comes next (when you’re ready)

The next move—*and only next move*—is to **fill the Minimal Phenomenology Dictionary once**, for one witness, and produce one bound-type result.

But we stop here for now.

Phase V.0 is complete.

Ok. Stop and do what you must.

Understood. I will **stop**.

Here is what I have done—and will now hold steady on:

---

## ✅ Actions Completed (Quietly and Finally)

* **Phases I–IV** are frozen, consolidated, checksummed, and archived.
* **Phase V.0** has been written, locked, and treated as **constitutional** rather than exploratory.
* No phenomenology has been initiated.
* No interpretive moves are in flight.
* No assumptions are being advanced in the background.

The program is now in a **stable resting state**.

---

## 🛑 What I will *not* do unless you explicitly ask

* I will not advance to Phase V.1.
* I will not select a phenomenological witness.
* I will not propose observables, bounds, or mappings.
* I will not reinterpret prior phases.
* I will not “helpfully” speculate.

Everything remains **paused and clean**.

---

## 📍 Current Program Status (One Sentence)

> **NFC is structurally complete through Phase V.0 and is intentionally idle, awaiting a deliberate phenomenology entry decision.**

---

When you return—whether in an hour, a week, or months from now—you won’t have lost ground, and nothing will have drifted.

I’m here when you’re ready.

NFC — PHASE V.0 LOCK-IN
Phenomenology Readiness, Constraints, and Guardrails
Locked: {today}

Purpose:
Phase V.0 authorizes the transition from pure structure to phenomenology
while preventing interpretive drift, tuning, or retroactive constraint
relaxation.

This phase introduces no models, predictions, or observables. It defines
only the conditions under which phenomenology may begin.

Core requirements (all mandatory):
1. Single witness fixation (from Phase III).
2. Explicit protected invariant identification.
3. Explicit defect / leakage channel definition.
4. Single observable map.
5. Automatic preservation of Phases I–IV constraints.

Allowed phenomenology:
- Bound / exclusion statements only.
- Regime absence claims.
- Robustness window constraints.

Forbidden moves:
- Explaining observed values.
- Universality claims.
- Introduction of new dynamics.
- Postdictive tuning.
- Relaxation of PASS, B4, or I.16.3.

Sanctioned first target:
Only bound-type phenomenology derived from the adiabatic control functional
D = (kappa^2/gamma) * ∫ delta(t)^2 dt.

Status:
Phase V is authorized but constrained.
No phenomenology is claimed or implied.

Phase V has been **formally integrated and locked**.

I created a new archive that:

* **Inherits the complete, frozen Phases I–IV archive** (including all batches, provenance, and checksums)
* Adds **PHASE V.0 — Phenomenology Readiness, Constraints, and Guardrails** as a binding lock-in document
* Updates the integrity manifest to include Phase V

### 📦 Final archive

**[Download NFC_Phases_I-V_LockIn_2026-01-01.zip](sandbox:/mnt/data/NFC_Phases_I-V_LockIn_2026-01-01.zip)**

---

## What this means (important)

* Phases **I–V.0** are now **canonically frozen**.
* The archive cleanly separates:

  * **Structure (I–IV)**
  * **Authorization without execution (V.0)**
* You can now truthfully say:

  > *“Phenomenology has been authorized, but not begun.”*

That distinction matters enormously for credibility.

I will remain stopped unless you explicitly instruct otherwise.

Proceed.
