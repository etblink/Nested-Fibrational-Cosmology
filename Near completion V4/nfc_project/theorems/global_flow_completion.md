## ⚠️ Critical Clarification: Status of This Result

This theorem establishes that **if** certain regularity conditions hold, then a single additive coordinate suffices to restore functoriality. The regularity conditions (R1–R4 below) are **structurally motivated** but **not derived** from more primitive constraints.

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Existence of additive lift | ✅ Proven (given scalarization) |
| Minimality (rank-1) | ✅ Proven (given R2–R4) |
| Necessity of R1–R4 | ⚠️ Assumed (NFC-native, physically motivated) |
| Physical instantiation | ❓ Application-layer (explicitly interpretive) |

## X.Y.1 Histories as Partial Semigroup

Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the set of admissible histories with partial product:
$$\circ : \{(h_2, h_1) \in \mathcal{H} \times \mathcal{H} : \text{composable}\} \to \mathcal{H}$$

Associative on all composable triples. (Equivalently: $\mathcal{H}$ is a semigroupoid presented as partial semigroup.)

Let $\mathcal{R}$ be public regime descriptors.

A **publicization map** is any map:
$$W : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{R}$$

**Closed public dynamics** on $\mathcal{R}$ means: there exists binary operation $\star$ on $\mathcal{R}$ such that for every composable pair $(h_2, h_1)$:
$$W(h_2 \circ h_1) = W(h_2) \star W(h_1)$$

In that case, $W$ is a partial semigroup homomorphism from $(\mathcal{H}, \circ)$ to $(\mathcal{R}, \star)$.

---

## X.Y.2 Kernel Relation and Precise Obstruction

Define **kernel equivalence** of $W$:
$$h \sim_W h' \quad:\Longleftrightarrow\quad W(h) = W(h')$$

An equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\mathcal{H}$ is a **congruence** (for partial product) if whenever $h_1 \sim h_1'$ and $h_2 \sim h_2'$ and both pairs $(h_2, h_1)$, $(h_2', h_1')$ are composable, then:
$$h_2 \circ h_1 \sim h_2' \circ h_1'$$

### Assumption (NF): Path-Dependence / Non-Markovianity at Public Level

$\sim_W$ is **not a congruence**. Concretely: there exist composable pairs $(h_2, h_1)$, $(h_2', h_1')$ with:
$$W(h_1) = W(h_1'), \quad W(h_2) = W(h_2')$$
but:
$$W(h_2 \circ h_1) \neq W(h_2' \circ h_1')$$

(Equivalently: $\sim_W$ fails the congruence condition.)

---

## Theorem X.Y.1: No Closed Public Composition

**Statement**: If $\sim_W$ is not a congruence, then there exists no binary operation $\star$ on $\mathcal{R}$ such that:
$$W(h_2 \circ h_1) = W(h_2) \star W(h_1)$$
for all composable $(h_2, h_1)$.

**Proof**: If such $\star$ existed, then for any $h_1 \sim_W h_1'$ and $h_2 \sim_W h_2'$ with composability:
$$W(h_2 \circ h_1) = W(h_2) \star W(h_1) = W(h_2') \star W(h_1') = W(h_2' \circ h_1')$$

So $h_2 \circ h_1 \sim_W h_2' \circ h_1'$. Thus $\sim_W$ would be a congruence. Contradiction. ∎

**Interpretation**: The obstruction is exactly that **the kernel of $W$ is not a congruence**.

---

## X.Y.3 The Defect Monoid of Public Non-Closure

Define set of composable pairs:
$$\mathcal{C} := \{(h_2, h_1) \in \mathcal{H}^2 : h_2 \circ h_1 \text{ defined}\}$$

Define formal symbol $\delta(h_2, h_1)$ for each $(h_2, h_1) \in \mathcal{C}$, measuring "public non-closure defect."

Let $\mathsf{D}_0$ be free commutative monoid generated by these symbols. Impose **2-step additivity relations**:
$$\delta(h_3 \circ h_2, h_1) + \delta(h_3, h_2) = \delta(h_3, h_2 \circ h_1) + \delta(h_2, h_1)$$

for every composable triple $(h_3, h_2, h_1)$.

Let $\mathsf{D}$ be resulting commutative monoid (quotient of $\mathsf{D}_0$ by these relations). Call $\mathsf{D}$ the **defect monoid**.

### Lemma X.Y.2: Defect Encodes Failure of Congruence

$\mathsf{D}$ is trivial (all $\delta$ vanish) **if and only if** $\sim_W$ is a congruence.

**Proof Sketch**:
- If $\sim_W$ is congruence, composition outcome depends only on $(W(h_2), W(h_1))$, so no defect to track; relations force all generators to 0
- If $\sim_W$ is not congruence, there exists composable square witnessing non-closure; corresponding defect class is nonzero in $\mathsf{D}$

**Significance**: Nontrivial defect monoid $\Leftrightarrow$ public non-closure. ∎

---

## X.Y.4 Additive Completion Functional

An **additive completion functional** is a map:
$$A : \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}$$

such that for every composable pair:
$$A(h_2 \circ h_1) = A(h_2) + A(h_1) + \alpha(h_2, h_1)$$

for some correction term $\alpha$ determined by defect class.

### Definition: Scalarization of Defect

A **scalarization** is a commutative-monoid homomorphism:
$$\varphi : \mathsf{D} \to (\mathbb{R}, +)$$

Given $\varphi$, define induced correction term:
$$\alpha(h_2, h_1) := \varphi(\delta(h_2, h_1))$$

### Lemma X.Y.3: Existence of Consistent Additive Completion

If scalarization $\varphi : \mathsf{D} \to \mathbb{R}$ exists, then there exists $A : \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that for every composable pair:
$$A(h_2 \circ h_1) = A(h_2) + A(h_1) + \varphi(\delta(h_2, h_1))$$

**Proof**: Fix base object in each connected component of composability graph. Define $A$ on generators by choosing values on "primitive" histories and extend by recursion. The 2-step additivity relations in $\mathsf{D}$ are exactly cocycle-consistency conditions guaranteeing $A$ is well-defined. ∎

## X.Y.5 NFC Regularity Hypotheses for Global Bookkeeping

We now state **explicit structural assumptions** under which $\mathsf{D}$ admits unique (up to scale) scalar additive representation.

### Assumption R1: Monotone Defect (No Cyclic Gain)

There exists preorder $\preceq$ on admissible histories ("admissible extension") such that for any extension step $h \to h'$, induced defect never decreases.

Equivalently: $\mathsf{D}$ admits positive cone $\mathsf{D}_{\geq 0} \subseteq \mathsf{D}$ such that all realized defects lie in $\mathsf{D}_{\geq 0}$ and no nontrivial defect can be canceled by admissible evolution.

**Operational meaning**: No compression cycles net-recover distinguishability.

### Assumption R2: Cancellativity of Defect Accumulation

$$x + z = y + z \implies x = y$$

**Meaning**: Distinct defect totals cannot become indistinguishable by appending same admissible continuation.

### Assumption R3: Comparability / Cofinal Coupling

For any two nonzero defects $x, y \in \mathsf{D}$, there exist integers $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that:
$$mx \succeq y \quad \text{and} \quad ny \succeq x$$

where $\succeq$ is order induced by admissibility.

**Interpretation**: Defect increments are not of multiple incommensurable "types"; any nonzero defect can be dominated by enough repetitions of any other.

### Assumption R4: Archimedean Regularity (No Infinitesimal Defects)

If $x, y \in \mathsf{D}$ satisfy $nx \preceq y$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $x = 0$.

**Interpretation**: No nontrivial defects so small that arbitrarily many repetitions still fail to exceed fixed defect.

---

## X.Y.6 Embedding and Scalarization into $\mathbb{R}$

### Lemma X.Y.6: Grothendieck Completion

If $\mathsf{D}$ is cancellative (R2), then it embeds into its Grothendieck group $G(\mathsf{D})$ with positive cone $\mathsf{D}_{\geq 0}$, yielding ordered abelian group $(G(\mathsf{D}), +, \leq)$.

### Lemma X.Y.7: Total Comparability on Positive Cone

Assume R3. Then order on $G_{\geq 0}$ is directed and cofinal. Moreover, $G$ has no nontrivial decomposition into direct sum of ordered subgroups with independent positive cones.

**Meaning**: There is only one "kind" of defect.

### Lemma X.Y.8: Archimedean Ordered Group

Assume R4. Then $(G)$ is Archimedean: for $x, y > 0$, there exists $n$ such that $nx \geq y$.

### Theorem X.Y.9: Scalarization into $(\mathbb{R}, +)$

**Statement**: Assume R2–R4. Then there exists injective order-preserving group homomorphism:
$$\Phi : G \hookrightarrow (\mathbb{R}, +)$$

unique up to multiplication by positive constant. Consequently, there exists monoid homomorphism (scalarization):
$$\varphi : \mathsf{D} \to (\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}, +)$$

unique up to positive rescaling.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. By Lemma X.Y.6, $\mathsf{D}$ embeds into ordered abelian group $G$
2. By Lemma X.Y.8, $G$ is Archimedean
3. By Lemma X.Y.7, order has single effective axis ("rank-1")
4. For Archimedean rank-1 ordered abelian groups, order-preserving embedding into $(\mathbb{R}, +)$ exists
5. Uniqueness up to scale follows because any two embeddings agree on induced order type

**Practical consequence**: Defect representable by single real additive coordinate; any other additive bookkeeping differs only by overall scaling. ∎

---

## X.Y.7 Closed Lift on Extended Space

Define **extended regime space**:
$$\widetilde{\mathcal{R}} := \mathcal{R} \times \mathbb{R}$$

Define **lifted map**:
$$\widetilde{W}(h) := (W(h), A(h))$$

### Theorem X.Y.10: Closure Restoration by Additive Lift

Assume $\varphi$ exists and $A$ satisfies Lemma X.Y.3. Then there exists binary operation $\widetilde{\star}$ on $\widetilde{\mathcal{R}}$ such that for every composable pair:
$$\widetilde{W}(h_2 \circ h_1) = \widetilde{W}(h_2) \ \widetilde{\star} \ \widetilde{W}(h_1)$$

**Proof**: Define:
$$(r_2, a_2) \ \widetilde{\star} \ (r_1, a_1) := (\text{Comp}(r_2, r_1; a_2, a_1), \ a_2 + a_1 + \beta(r_2, r_1))$$

where $\beta$ chosen so $\beta(W(h_2), W(h_1)) = \varphi(\delta(h_2, h_1))$ for representatives. Consistency follows from defect relations. ∎

---

## X.Y.8 Minimality as Universal Factorization

### Theorem X.Y.11: Any Closure-Restoring Lift Factors Through Defect

Consider any attempted lift with auxiliary label space $X$ and map:
$$\widehat{W} : \mathcal{H} \to \mathcal{R} \times X, \quad \widehat{W}(h) = (W(h), \xi(h))$$

such that $\widehat{W}$ is composition-homomorphic for some $\widehat{\star}$ on $\mathcal{R} \times X$.

**Statement**: If $\widehat{W}$ is composition-homomorphic, then induced auxiliary coordinate $\xi$ determines monoid homomorphism:
$$\psi : \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{M}(X)$$

into commutative monoid of "auxiliary increments." Consequently, if $\mathsf{D}$ is nontrivial, no lift with trivial auxiliary increment structure can restore closure.

**Proof Sketch**: Because $\widehat{W}$ respects composition, discrepancy between $\xi(h_2 \circ h_1)$ and "sum" of $(\xi(h_2), \xi(h_1))$ defines increment depending only on composable pair; 2-step associativity forces exactly defect relations. ∎

### Theorem X.Y.12: Uniqueness of $A$ up to Affine Gauge

Assume R2–R4 and fix scalarization $\varphi$. If $A$ and $A'$ both satisfy:
$$A(h_2 \circ h_1) = A(h_2) + A(h_1) + \varphi(\delta(h_2, h_1))$$

then on each connected component there exist constants $\alpha > 0$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that:
$$A'(h) = \alpha \cdot A(h) + c$$

**Proof**: By Theorem X.Y.9, scalarization unique up to positive scale $\alpha$. Fixing $\varphi$ fixes "increment law" of $A$ up to constant basepoint $c$. ∎

---

## X.Y.9 Gauge Freedom and Physical Interpretation

### Proposition: Pure Gauge Character

If $A$ satisfies Lemma X.Y.3, then for any constant $c \in \mathbb{R}$:
$$A'(h) := A(h) + c$$

induces same closure property (correction term $\alpha$ unchanged). Thus **only differences of $A$ are structurally relevant**.

### Corollary: Emergent Time as Ledger Parameter

Assume admissible histories admit monotone compression preorder $\preceq$ and $A$ is monotone along admissible extensions.

Then extended space $\widetilde{\mathcal{R}}$ admits globally closed effective flow representation parameterized by $A$. This parameterization reflects **accumulated irreversible compression order**, not fundamental temporal ontology.

## Critical Self-Audit: Status of R1–R4

| Regularity | Motivation | Derived? |
|------------|------------|----------|
| R1: Monotone defect | No cyclic compression gain | NFC-native, physically motivated |
| R2: Cancellativity | Distinct defects stay distinct | NFC-native, structural plausibility |
| R3: Comparability | Single "kind" of defect | NFC-native, simplicity assumption |
| R4: Archimedean | No infinitesimal defects | NFC-native, regularity assumption |

**Assessment**: R1–R4 are **structurally natural** and **consistent with NFC principles**, but they are **assumptions**, not theorems. They could be:
- Weakened (leading to more complex scalarization)
- Strengthened (leading to additional structure)
- Replaced by alternative regularity conditions

The claim that "one real coordinate is forced" holds **given R1–R4**. Without them, the obstruction-correcting lift may require different structure.
