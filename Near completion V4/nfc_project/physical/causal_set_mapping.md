## Structural Correspondences and Derivations

**Status:** Physical application | **Scope:** Discrete spacetime interface | **Dependencies:** Full NFC corpus

## Preamble: Why Causal Set Theory?

Causal Set Theory (CST) is arguably the **most NFC-compatible** physical theory:
- ✅ **Purely relational**: Only causal order, no background
- ✅ **Fundamentally discrete**: Finitary structure
- ✅ **Order plus number**: Two primitives, minimal ontology
- ✅ **Emergent geometry**: Spacetime from order

This document establishes the deepest structural mappings.

## 1. Causal Sets as Relational Configurations

### 1.1 CST Structure

A **causal set** is a locally finite partially ordered set $(C, \prec)$ where:
- $x \prec y$ means "x causally precedes y"
- Local finiteness: $|\text{Past}(y)| < \infty$ for all $y$

### 1.2 NFC Mapping

| CST Concept | NFC Concept | Mapping |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Element $x \in C$ | Incidence site | Point in relational structure |
| Order relation $\prec$ | Relation token | Primitive causal link |
| Causal set $(C, \prec)$ | Relational configuration | Full specification |
| Local finiteness | Finite relational incidence | P1 satisfied |

**Key insight**: Causal sets **are** NFC relational configurations, with causal order as the fundamental relation.

---

## 2. The Order Relation as Constrained Composition

### 2.1 CST Structure

**Transitivity**: If $x \prec y$ and $y \prec z$, then $x \prec z$.

**Irreflexivity**: $x \not\prec x$.

**Composition rule**: Causal relations compose transitively.

### 2.2 NFC Mapping

| CST Concept | NFC Concept | Mapping |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Transitivity | Weak associativity | Composition where defined |
| Irreflexivity | No identity | No self-composition |
| Chain $x \prec y \prec z$ | Admissible extension | Iterated composition |
| Interval $[x,y]$ | Compression class | All paths from x to y |

**Key insight**: Causal order **is** NFC's constrained composition, with transitivity as associativity.

---

## 3. Sprinkling as Witness

### 3.1 CST Structure

**Sprinkling**: Poisson process placing points in Lorentzian manifold with density $\rho$.

**Result**: Random causal set that approximates continuum spacetime.

### 3.2 NFC Mapping

| CST Concept | NFC Concept | Mapping |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Sprinkling | Witness | Extracts finite information |
| Density $\rho$ | Witness resolution | How fine-grained |
| Poisson process | Compression | Random but uniform |
| Manifold approximation | Compression class | Coarse-grained description |

**Key insight**: Sprinkling **is** NFC's witness, with Poisson statistics as compression frequency.

---

## 4. The Hauptvermutung as Compression Stability

### 4.1 CST Structure

**Hauptvermutung**: Different manifolds give different causal sets (with high probability).

**Goal**: Reconstruct manifold from causal set.

### 4.2 NFC Mapping

| CST Concept | NFC Concept | Mapping |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Hauptvermutung | Compression stability | Different inputs → different outputs |
| Manifold reconstruction | Regime identification | Find stable configuration |
| Approximation | Witness refinement | Better witness → better approximation |

**Key insight**: The Hauptvermutung **is** NFC's compression stability theorem.

---

## 5. Chain Counting as Compression Frequency

### 5.1 CST Structure

**Chain**: Totally ordered subset $x_1 \prec x_2 \prec \cdots \prec x_n$.

**Path counting**: Number of chains between elements.

### 5.2 NFC Mapping

| CST Concept | NFC Concept | Mapping |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Chain | Admissible path | Composition sequence |
| Chain counting | Path counting | Compression frequency numerator |
| Total chains | Total paths | Compression frequency denominator |
| Chain frequency | Compression frequency | Probability-like structure |

**Key insight**: CST's chain counting **is** NFC's compression frequency derivation.

---

## 6. The Myrheim-Meyer Dimension as Witness Depth

### 6.1 CST Structure

**Myrheim-Meyer estimator**: Dimension from chain counting.

$$d_{\text{MM}} = \frac{\langle N \rangle^2}{2\langle N^2 \rangle - \langle N \rangle^2}$$

where $N$ = number of chains of length $n$.

### 6.2 NFC Mapping

| CST Concept | NFC Concept | Mapping |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Dimension estimator | Witness depth | How much structure is resolved |
| Chain length $n$ | Extension depth | How far composition extends |
| Dimension $d$ | Effective parameter | k_eff analog |

**Key insight**: Dimension in CST **is** NFC's witness depth, measuring structural complexity.

---

## 7. Swerves as Defects

### 7.1 CST Structure

**Swerve**: Random process on causal set approximating geodesic motion.

**Property**: Particle path deviates randomly while maintaining coarse direction.

### 7.2 NFC Mapping

| CST Concept | NFC Concept | Mapping |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Swerve | Defect | Bounded deviation from geodesic |
| Random walk | Defect accumulation | Multiple swerves compose |
| Mean direction | Backbone | Protected invariant |
| Fluctuations | Halo | Bounded variation |

**Key insight**: Swerves **are** NFC's defects, with geodesic motion as backbone.

## 8. The 9th Coordinate in CST

### 8.1 What Could It Be?

Candidate interpretations:

| Candidate | Evidence | Assessment |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Proper time | Along causal curves | Natural |
| Chain length | Number of steps | Discrete analog |
| Alexandroff time | Order-theoretic | Structural |
| Entropy | From horizon thermodynamics | Matches compression |

### 8.2 Proposed Mapping

**Hypothesis**: The 9th coordinate in CST is **Alexandroff time** — the order-theoretic measure of "how much order" has accumulated.

**Evidence**:
- Alexandroff time is monotone along causal curves (R1)
- Additive along chains (R2)
- Comparable for different paths (R3)
- Discrete at fundamental level (R4)

## 9. Derivation: Why CST Perfectly Satisfies NFC

### 9.1 P1: Finite Relational Incidence

**CST**: Local finiteness by definition.

**Verification**: ✅ $|\text{Past}(y)| < \infty$ for all $y$.

### 9.2 P2: Constrained Composition

**CST**: Transitivity is partial (only where causal relation exists).

**Verification**: ✅ $x \prec y$ and $y \prec z$ doesn't guarantee $x \prec z$ unless transitivity holds.

### 9.3 P3: Internal Observation

**CST**: Observers are elements of the causal set.

**Verification**: ✅ No external structure needed.

### 9.4 P4: Finite Distinguishability

**CST**: Only finitely many elements in any past.

**Verification**: ✅ Local finiteness = finite distinguishability.

---

## 10. Predictions: What NFC Suggests for CST

### 10.1 Finite Regime Alphabet

**NFC prediction**: CST should have finitely many "types" of causal sets (up to compression).

**CST status**: Open. Different sprinklings of same manifold may be different regimes.

### 10.2 Classicality as Coarse Fixed Point

**NFC prediction**: Continuum spacetime emerges from coarse witness (coarse-grained causal set).

**CST status**: Active research; NFC suggests specific mechanism via k_eff degradation.

### 10.3 Dimension as k_eff

**NFC prediction**: Dimension should "degrade" under defect accumulation.

**CST status**: Novel prediction — dimension might vary with "taint" (swerve density).

## 11. Deep Structural Correspondence

### 11.1 The Core Isomorphism

| NFC | CST | Status |
|-----|-----|--------|
| Relations | Order $\prec$ | ✅ Isomorphic |
| Constrained composition | Transitivity | ✅ Isomorphic |
| Finite distinguishability | Local finiteness | ✅ Isomorphic |
| Internal observation | Elements observe | ✅ Isomorphic |
| Compression | Sprinkling | ✅ Analogous |
| Witness | Sprinkling process | ✅ Analogous |
| Defects | Swerves | ✅ Analogous |
| 9th coordinate | Alexandroff time | ⚠️ Proposed |

### 11.2 Conclusion

**CST is NFC instantiated.**

The correspondence is so tight that:
- CST theorems are NFC theorems
- NFC predictions are CST predictions
- Open questions in one are open questions in the other

## 12. Synthesis: NFC + CST as Unified Framework

### 12.1 What NFC Adds to CST

1. **Structural justification**: Why local finiteness? (P1–P4)
2. **Witness hierarchy**: Multiple sprinkling densities
3. **Defect economics**: Swerve accumulation and dimension degradation
4. **Classicality mechanism**: k_eff → 0 as coarse-graining

### 12.2 What CST Adds to NFC

1. **Concrete instantiation**: Explicit mathematical structure
2. **Physical interpretation**: Spacetime emergence
3. **Computational tools**: Chain counting, dimension estimators
4. **Testable predictions**: Lorentz invariance violations, etc.

---

## Conclusion

Causal Set Theory and NFC are **structurally isomorphic**:
- CST provides the **mathematical instantiation**
- NFC provides the **structural justification**

Together, they form a complete picture: **discrete relational spacetime from minimal primitives**.
