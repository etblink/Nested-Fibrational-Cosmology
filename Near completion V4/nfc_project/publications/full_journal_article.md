# Incidence Before Identity: A Structural Derivation of Persistence, Symmetry, and Interaction from Relational Primitives

**Authors:** [Author names withheld for review]

**Abstract:** We present a complete derivation of fundamental structures—identity, persistence, symmetry, and interaction—from strictly relational primitives. Assuming only finite relational incidence, constrained composition, and internal observation, and explicitly excluding primitive identity, time, dynamics, and semantics, we prove: (1) primitive identity forces structural collapse; (2) identity, if it appears, arises as derived compression of invariant relational behavior; (3) persistence requires stabilizer-supported compression classes ("survivors"); (4) multiple survivors force asymmetric, defect-mediated interaction; (5) such interaction induces protected approximate symmetry and finite regime structure. We establish explicit mappings to Loop Quantum Gravity and Causal Set Theory, demonstrating that these quantum gravity approaches satisfy our constraints. The framework provides a structural meta-language for understanding emergence in physical theories.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Foundational Problem

Relational approaches to foundational physics aim to minimize ontological commitments by treating relations as primary [1,2,3]. However, one assumption is almost always retained implicitly: **identity**. Relations are typically taken to relate the same relata across compositions, iterations, or observational contexts.

In strictly relational and finitary frameworks, this retention is not benign. Without background structure to stabilize reference, re-identification itself must be supported by admissible relations. We prove that primitive identity is structurally impossible and show how identity, persistence, and interaction emerge from minimal primitives.

### 1.2 Relation to Existing Work

Our framework builds on:
- **Category-theoretic approaches** [4,5]: We make functoriality claims rigorous
- **Topos theory in physics** [6]: We interpret witnesses as sheaves
- **Structural realism** [7,8]: We provide precise mathematical content
- **Quantum gravity approaches** [9,10,11]: We establish explicit mappings

Our contribution is the **complete derivation chain** from primitives to emergent structure.

### 1.3 Standing Assumptions

**Primitives (exhaustive):**
1. **P1**: Finite relational incidence
2. **P2**: Constrained (partial, typed, weakly associative) composition
3. **P3**: Internal observation (relational subsystems, no external viewpoint)
4. **P4**: Finite distinguishability

**Explicitly excluded:** Primitive identity, objects, time, dynamics, probability, background space, semantics, external observers.

## 2. The Identity No-Go Theorem

### 2.1 Definitions

**Definition 2.1 (Primitive Identity).** A system admits primitive identity if it licenses re-identification across admissible extensions not derived from relational behavior, observational congruence, or stability conditions.

**Definition 2.2 (Collapse).** A system collapses if it degenerates into: (a) trivialization (indiscriminate indistinguishability); (b) fragmentation (failure of composition); or (c) observer inconsistency (incompatible identity assignments).

### 2.2 Theorem

**Theorem 2.3 (Identity No-Go).** In any finite relational system with constrained composition and internal observation, primitive identity forces collapse.

**Proof (exhaustion).** Any enforcement of identity must be: (i) universal → trivialization (Lemma 2.4); (ii) selective → fragmentation (Lemma 2.5); or (iii) contextual → observer inconsistency (Lemma 2.6). These exhaust possibilities. ∎

**Lemma 2.4–2.6.** [Proofs as in NFC corpus]

### 2.3 Corollary

**Corollary 2.7.** Identity cannot be taken as primitive in any non-collapsing finite relational framework.

---

## 3. Derived Identity as Compression

### 3.1 Definitions

**Definition 3.1 (Compression Class).** Equivalence class of configurations indistinguishable under all admissible tests.

**Definition 3.2 (Derived Identity).** A compression class that is invariant under admissible composition and stable under admissible extension.

### 3.2 Theorems

**Theorem 3.3 (Compression is Forced).** In any finite relational system with internal observation, compression classes form.

*Proof.* Finite distinguishability → finite number of observable distinctions → equivalence classes. ∎

**Theorem 3.4 (Derived Identity Avoids Collapse).** Derived identity: (a) does not trivialize structure; (b) does not fragment composition; (c) is consistent across observers.

---

## 4. Protected Approximate Symmetry (PASS)

### 4.1 Obstruction to Exact Symmetry

**Theorem 4.1 (Exact Symmetry Obstructed).** Exact symmetry is incompatible with singular projection interfaces.

### 4.2 PASS Theorem

**Theorem 4.2 (PASS).** In any finite relational system with singular projections, any non-collapsing symmetry must be approximate and protected.

### 4.3 Backbone-Halo Decomposition

**Theorem 4.3.** PASS induces unique partition into backbone (invariant) and halo (bounded variation).

**Theorem 4.4.** Protection is one-way: halo cannot backreact on backbone.

---

## 5. Survivors and Stabilizers

### 5.1 Stabilizers

**Definition 5.1 (Stabilizer).** Relation S stabilizing compression class C if: (a) incidence-neutral; (b) observationally invariant; (c) commutes with extension.

**Theorem 5.2 (Stabilizer Necessity and Sufficiency).** Compression class persists iff it admits stabilizers.

### 5.2 Survivors

**Definition 5.3 (Survivor).** Compression class that is extension-invariant, has stabilizer support, and admits no admissible refinement.

**Theorem 5.4 (Finite Survivors).** In any finite relational neighborhood, the number of survivors is finite.

---

## 6. Defect-Mediated Interaction

### 6.1 Symmetric Coexistence Collapse

**Theorem 6.1.** Exact symmetric coexistence of distinct survivors is impossible.

### 6.2 Forced Asymmetry and Defects

**Theorem 6.2.** If multiple survivors coexist non-trivially, interaction must be asymmetric.

**Definition 6.3 (Defect).** Relation modifying admissible paths without altering stabilizers.

**Theorem 6.4 (Defect Mediation).** All stable survivor interaction is defect-mediated.

---

## 7. Regime Structure

**Definition 7.1 (Regime).** Joint survivor configuration that is joint extension-invariant and defect-tolerant.

**Theorem 7.2 (Finite Regime Alphabet).** The set of regimes is finite.

---

## 8. The 9th Coordinate

### 8.1 Non-Functoriality

Witness composition is generally non-functorial: $W(h_2 \circ h_1) \neq W(h_2) \circ W(h_1)$.

### 8.2 Additive Completion

**Theorem 8.1.** Under regularity assumptions (R1–R4), a single additive coordinate suffices to restore functoriality.

**Theorem 8.2.** The 9th coordinate is pure gauge (defined up to affine shift).

---

## 9. Physical Mappings

### 9.1 Loop Quantum Gravity

| LQG Concept | NFC Concept |
|-------------|-------------|
| Spin networks | Relational configurations |
| Holonomy-flux algebra | Witness non-commutativity |
| Spin foams | Admissible extensions |
| Coherent states | Survivor-stabilizer pairs |
| Hamiltonian constraint | Defect |

LQG satisfies NFC constraints P1–P4.

### 9.2 Causal Set Theory

| CST Concept | NFC Concept |
|-------------|-------------|
| Causal order | Relation |
| Local finiteness | Finite distinguishability |
| Sprinkling | Witness |
| Chain counting | Compression frequency |
| Swerves | Defects |

CST is structurally isomorphic to NFC.

## 10. Conclusion

We have derived from minimal relational primitives:
- Identity as compression (not primitive)
- Persistence via stabilizers (not automatic)
- Asymmetric interaction via defects (not optional)
- Finite regime structure (not assumed)
- Global flow completion via 9th coordinate (not fundamental)

**No time, dynamics, probability, or semantics were assumed.**

The framework provides structural constraints on physical theories and explicit mappings to quantum gravity approaches.
