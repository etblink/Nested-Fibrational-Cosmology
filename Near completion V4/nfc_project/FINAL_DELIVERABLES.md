## Computational Results Summary

### U12 Simulator Output

```
Generated 436 total paths (218 from h0, 218 from h1)

Compression Frequencies:
- Coarse (W_c): C = 1.000
- Medium (W_m): A = 0.573, B = 0.427
- Fine (W_f): 0 = 0.500, 1 = 0.500

Witness Depth Degradation:
- D = 0: k_eff = 2.00 (quantum-like)
- D = 2: k_eff = 1.00 (threshold Θ₁)
- D = 4: k_eff = 0.00 (threshold Θ₀, classical)
```

## Honest Assessment: What Has Been Achieved

### ✅ Fully Achieved

| Goal | Status |
|------|--------|
| Complete formalization of core theorems | ✅ 15+ theorems |

## Theoretical Contributions

### Novel Concepts Introduced

1. **Derived identity** — Identity as compression, not primitive
2. **Stabilizers** — Incidence-neutral relations enabling persistence
3. **Survivor-stabilizer pairs** — Objects as structural fixed points
4. **Defect-mediated interaction** — Asymmetric coupling without backreaction
5. **Protected approximate symmetry (PASS)** — Approximate invariance from non-collapse
6. **Compression frequency** — Probability-like structure from counting
7. **9th coordinate** — Additive lift restoring functoriality
8. **Witness depth k** — Refinement level as structural parameter
9. **Resolution budget k_eff** — Degradation of accessible structure

### Mathematical Contributions

1. **Partial category theory** — Composition without total functoriality
2. **Defect 2-category** — Higher-categorical interaction structure
3. **Witness topos** — Sheaf semantics for observational contexts
4. **Defect torsors** — Classifying space for interaction
5. **Regularity analysis** — Alternative conditions for scalarization

### Physical Contributions

1. **LQG correspondence** — Explicit structural mapping
2. **CST isomorphism** — Near-perfect structural match
3. **Classicality mechanism** — k_eff → 0 as coarse-graining
4. **Decoherence economics** — Defect budget and witness degradation

## Recommendations for Future Work

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. **Submit journal article** to Foundations of Physics or similar
2. **Collaborate with LQG/CST researchers** on explicit predictions
3. **Develop more toy families** with varied parameters
4. **Compute quantitative bounds** for physical systems

### Medium-Term

5. **Extend to quantum information** — resource theories, entanglement
6. **Explore cosmological applications** — 9th coordinate as time
7. **Develop experimental proposals** — even gedanken experiments
8. **Compare with other relational approaches** — ER=EPR, etc.

### Long-Term

9. **Derive or exclude Born rule** — critical open question
10. **Unify with quantum information** — circuit models, etc.
11. **Connect to phenomenology** — Lorentz violations, etc.
12. **Develop educational materials** — make NFC accessible
