# NFC as Scientific Methodology
## A Framework for Theory Development

**Status:** Methodological investigation | **Scope:** Philosophy of science practice | **Dependencies:** Full NFC corpus

## Preamble: Beyond Philosophy

NFC is not just a metaphysical position — it is a **methodology** for:
- Developing scientific theories
- Evaluating existing theories
- Identifying hidden assumptions
- Guiding research programs

This document outlines NFC as practical scientific method.

## 1. The NFC Method: Core Principles

### 1.1 Principle 1: Minimize Ontology

**Rule**: Start with the fewest possible primitives.

**Rationale**: Every primitive is a potential source of error or confusion.

**NFC primitives**:
1. Finite relational incidence
2. Constrained composition
3. Internal observation

**Application**: When developing a theory, ask: "What is the minimal ontology needed?"

---

### 1.2 Principle 2: Derive, Don't Assume

**Rule**: No structure may be used unless derived.

**Rationale**: Assumptions hide dependencies and create circularity risk.

**NFC derivation chain**:
```
Primitives → Compression → Identity → Stabilizers → Survivors → Regimes → Probability-like structure
```

**Application**: For each concept in your theory, trace it back to primitives or flag it as assumption.

---

### 1.3 Principle 3: Audit Derivability

**Rule**: Maintain explicit dependency graph.

**Rationale**: Ensures no smuggling, enables criticism.

**NFC tool**: Derivability ledger

| Structure | Depends On | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Identity | Compression + stability | ✅ Derived |
| Persistence | Stabilizers | ✅ Derived |
| Probability | Regimes + irreversibility | ⚠️ Partial |

**Application**: Create ledger for your theory; check for circularity.

---

### 1.4 Principle 4: Respect Collapse Gates

**Rule**: Identify what would make theory collapse.

**Rationale**: Understanding failure modes strengthens theory.

**NFC collapse modes**:
- Trivialization (indiscriminate)
- Fragmentation (vacuous)
- Observer inconsistency

**Application**: For your theory, ask: "What would make it collapse?"

---

## 2. NFC Method in Practice: Theory Development

### 2.1 Step 1: Identify Primitives

**Question**: What are the fundamental building blocks?

**Example — Quantum Mechanics**:
- Hilbert space vectors?
- Operators?
- Measurement outcomes?

**NFC critique**: QM has many primitives; can they be reduced?

---

### 2.2 Step 2: Check Compatibility

**Question**: Does theory satisfy NFC constraints?

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Finite relational incidence?
- [ ] Constrained composition?
- [ ] Internal observation?
- [ ] Finite distinguishability?

**Example — Classical Mechanics**:
- ❌ Infinite phase space
- ❌ Continuous trajectories
- ✅ Composition (Hamiltonian flow)

**NFC verdict**: Classical mechanics is emergent, not fundamental.

---

### 2.3 Step 3: Identify Hidden Assumptions

**Question**: What is assumed but not derived?

**Common hidden assumptions**:
- Time (primitive vs. emergent)
- Identity (primitive vs. derived)
- Probability (primitive vs. compression frequency)
- Space (background vs. relational)

**Example — Quantum Field Theory**:
- Assumes: continuous spacetime
- NFC question: Can this be derived or approximated?

---

### 2.4 Step 4: Map to NFC Structure

**Question**: What NFC concepts correspond to theory concepts?

**Template**:
| Theory Concept | NFC Concept | Status |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| States | Compression classes | ? |
| Observables | Witnesses | ? |
| Dynamics | Admissible extension | ? |
| Measurement | Witness activation | ? |

**Example — Loop Quantum Gravity**:
| LQG | NFC | Status |
|-----|-----|--------|
| Spin networks | Relational configs | ✅ |
| Holonomy-flux | Witness non-commutativity | ✅ |
| Spin foams | Admissible extension | ✅ |

---

## 3. NFC Method in Practice: Theory Evaluation

### 3.1 Evaluating Quantum Gravity Approaches

| Approach | NFC Compatibility | Assessment |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| String Theory | ⚠️ Partial | Background-dependent, infinite modes |
| Loop Quantum Gravity | ✅ High | Discrete, relational, background-free |
| Causal Set Theory | ✅ Excellent | Purely relational, finitary |
| Asymptotic Safety | ⚠️ Partial | Continuous, scale-dependent |
| CDT | ✅ High | Discrete, relational |

**NFC recommendation**: Prioritize LQG, CST, CDT for foundational work.

---

### 3.2 Evaluating Interpretations of QM

| Interpretation | NFC Compatibility | Assessment |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Copenhagen | ⚠️ Partial | Measurement primitive, external observer |
| Many-Worlds | ⚠️ Partial | Branching structure, no collapse |
| Bohmian | ❌ Low | Trajectories, particle positions |
| QBism | ⚠️ Partial | Subjective probability |
| Relational QM | ✅ High | Internal observers, contextuality |

**NFC recommendation**: Relational QM is most compatible; others need modification.

## 4. NFC Method in Practice: Research Guidance

### 4.1 Open Problems in NFC Terms

| Problem | NFC Formulation |
|---------|-----------------|
| Quantum gravity | Find NFC-compatible theory with emergent spacetime |
| Measurement problem | Understand witness activation mechanism |
| Arrow of time | Explain monotone compression order |
| Fine-tuning | Explain why certain regimes are selected |

### 4.2 Research Strategies

**Strategy 1: Toy Development**
- Build explicit NFC-compatible models
- Test structural predictions
- Identify quantitative behavior

**Strategy 2: Physical Mapping**
- Map existing theories to NFC
- Identify violations
- Propose modifications

**Strategy 3: Mathematical Development**
- Strengthen partial results
- Explore alternative regularities
- Develop computational tools

## 5. NFC and Scientific Progress

### 5.1 Kuhnian Paradigms

**Normal science**: Work within NFC-compatible framework.

**Revolution**: Discover NFC violation → new framework needed.

**NFC prediction**: True revolutions involve change in primitives, not just structure.

### 5.2 Lakatosian Research Programs

**Hard core**: NFC primitives (P1–P4).

**Protective belt**: Specific instantiations (toys, physical mappings).

**Progressive**: New predictions from NFC structure.

**Degenerating**: Ad hoc modifications to save NFC.

## 6. Objections to NFC Methodology

### 6.1 Too Restrictive?

**Objection**: NFC rules out too many theories.

**Reply**: NFC is **foundational constraint**, not selector. Theories can:
- Satisfy NFC (ideal)
- Approximate NFC (acceptable)
- Violate NFC (need justification)

### 6.2 Too Abstract?

**Objection**: NFC is too far from experiment.

**Reply**: NFC is **meta-theoretical**. Testability comes via:
- Physical instantiations
- Structural constraints
- Computational verification

### 6.3 Too New?

**Objection**: NFC hasn't been proven.

**Reply**: NFC is **methodology**, not theory. Its value is in:
- Disciplining theory-building
- Identifying hidden assumptions
- Providing unified language

---

## 7. Conclusion: NFC as Living Methodology

NFC is not a finished product — it is a **framework for ongoing development**:

1. **Core principles** are fixed (P1–P4)
2. **Derivations** are audited and improvable
3. **Applications** are expanding
4. **Methods** are being refined

**The goal**: A scientific methodology that is:
- Minimal in ontology
- Rigorous in derivation
- Applicable to physics
- Open to criticism
