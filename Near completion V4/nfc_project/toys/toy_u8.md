# Toy Universe 𝕌₈: Coherent Pocket with Bounded Leakage
## Explicit Example — Existence Proof (Not Uniqueness)

**Status:** Existence demonstrated | **Type:** Illustrative toy | **Scope:** Application-layer (explicitly marked)

---

## ⚠️ Critical Preamble: What This Toy Is and Is Not

### What This Toy IS

- An **existence proof**: Shows that the NFC framework *can* exhibit quantum-like multiplicity, coherent pockets, bounded leakage, and classical fixed points
- A **concrete instantiation**: Makes abstract concepts (defects, witnesses, compression) explicit and computable
- A **consistency check**: Verifies that the primitives (relations, constrained composition, finite distinguishability) are mutually compatible

### What This Toy Is NOT

| Claim | Status | Clarification |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| "This is the only possible toy" | ❌ FALSE | Other toys with different behavior may exist |
| "This proves quantum mechanics" | ❌ FALSE | Shows structural *analogue*, not physical derivation |
| "Classicality is forced" | ❌ FALSE | Classical fixed point exists under *this* coarse witness; other witnesses may behave differently |
| "The gap γ = 2 is necessary" | ❌ FALSE | This is a parameter choice for illustration |

**This toy demonstrates possibility, not necessity.**

## A. Primitive Tokens (No Objects, No Meanings)

### Incidence Sites

Let $\mathcal{I} = \{a, b, c, d\}$ (marks only, no structure)

### Relation Tokens (8 total)

Each relation is a token $r = (S_r, T_r)$ with finite $S_r, T_r \subset \mathcal{I}$.

**Backbone candidates (level 0):**
- $b_1 := (\{a\}, \{b\})$
- $b_2 := (\{b\}, \{c\})$
- $b_3 := (\{c\}, \{d\})$

**Halo regime tokens (level 1):**
- $h_0 := (\{a\}, \{d\})$
- $h_1 := (\{a\}, \{d\})$ (distinct token, same incidence as $h_0$)

**Defect tokens (level 1):**
- $\delta^{(1)} := (\{b\}, \{b\})$ (sub-gap candidate)
- $\delta^{(2)} := (\{c\}, \{c\})$ (super-gap candidate)

**Witness context (level 1):**
- $w := (\{d\}, \{d\})$

**No identity element is assumed.**

---

## B. Typed Partial Composition

### Admissibility Rule

Incidence-composition is defined **only when** $T_r \cap S_{r'} \neq \varnothing$, and then:
$$r' \circ r := (S_r, T_{r'})$$

This is **partial**; many pairs don't compose.

### Key Composites

- $b_2 \circ b_1 = (\{a\}, \{c\})$
- $b_3 \circ b_2 \circ b_1 = (\{a\}, \{d\})$

So $h_0$ and $h_1$ match the same incidence pattern as the backbone composite—but they remain **distinct tokens** until compression.

---

## C. Stratification + Projection

**Levels**: $\ell(b_i) = 0$; $\ell(h_0) = \ell(h_1) = \ell(\delta^{(1)}) = \ell(\delta^{(2)}) = \ell(w) = 1$

**Projection $\pi$ on level-1**:
- $\pi(h_0) = \pi(h_1) = b_3 \circ b_2 \circ b_1$
- $\pi(\delta^{(k)})$ undefined in base (defects don't become backbone)
- $\pi(w)$ undefined in base (witnesses aren't base laws)

This is the minimal "many-to-one fiber" for compression pressure.

---

## D. PASS-Shaped Split

We declare (application-layer realization of PASS):

- **Protected sector**: Generated by $b_i$ relations and their admissible composites
- **Halo sector**: Contains $\{h_0, h_1\}$ and witness/defect tokens
- **Halo↔backbone coupling**: **Only through defect tokens**

This matches "defect-only coupling" interface form.

---

## E. Witness Families (Fine vs. Coarse)

### Fine Witness $W_f = \{w\}$

$W_f$ reports which halo token is present when probed in admissible contexts.

**Behavior**:
- Distinguishes $h_0$ from $h_1$ at token level
- Reports distinct values for distinct tokens

### Coarse Witness $W_c = \{\}$ (or witness reporting only projected base)

$W_c$ **cannot** distinguish $h_0$ vs $h_1$; it only "sees" their shared projection.

**Behavior**:
- $\kappa_{f \to c}(h_0) = \kappa_{f \to c}(h_1) = C$ (single coarse class)

---

## F. Gap Threshold and Coherent Pocket

Set **witness gap threshold** $\gamma = 2$ over defect alphabet $\{\delta^{(1)}, \delta^{(2)}\}$:

- $\delta^{(1)}$ is **sub-gap**: Invisible to fine witness except as harmless micro-variation
- $\delta^{(2)}$ is **super-gap**: Witness-visible; can cause regime switching

### Coherent Pocket Statement (Toy-Level)

> As long as only $\delta^{(1)}$ is admissible, the evolution of the halo under admissible extension remains inside the $W_c$-equivalence class $C$, and $W_f$ sees no stable regime change.

This is "coherence": multiplicity exists at token level, but is not forced into public branching.

---

## G. Bounded Leakage / Drift

Allow repeated admissible extensions where $\delta^{(2)}$ sometimes appears.

### Canon-Level Control Statement

Leakage probability is bounded by gap-controlled functional and defect strength. Protected drift is quadratic in defect strength.

### Toy Interpretation

Interpret "extension depth" as parameter $T$ in leakage/drift bounds (application choice, not primitive):

- While defect budget $\int \delta(t)^2 dt$ stays small relative to $\gamma$: coherent pocket persists
- As budget grows: drift/leakage increases but remains bounded (no catastrophic backreaction—PASS forbids halo→backbone feedback)

---

## H. Classical Fixed Point

Under coarse witness $W_c$:

- Both $h_0$ and $h_1$ always compress to same public class $C$
- Even when super-gap defects occur, public report is stable once witness can't resolve branching

**This is the classical fixed point**: stable public regime under coarse-graining, despite micro-branching under $W_f$.

---

## I. What This Toy Demonstrates (Auditably)

| Feature | Mechanism | Interpretation-Free Statement |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Quantum-like multiplicity | $W_f$ supports >1 incompressible extension class | Token-level distinguishability |
| Coherent pocket | Sub-gap defects don't produce public branching | Gap-controlled stability |
| Bounded decay | Super-gap defects cause controlled drift/leakage | Quadratic defect bound |
| Classicality | $W_c$ forces immediate collapse to single class $C$ | Coarse witness compression |

---

## J. Explicit Limitations (Self-Audit)

### What This Toy Does NOT Prove

1. **Uniqueness**: Other parameter choices, other typing rules, other witness families may yield different behavior
2. **Necessity**: The framework does not force this specific structure; it merely permits it
3. **Physical mapping**: Whether physical systems instantiate this structure requires application-layer work
4. **Quantitative accuracy**: The gap $\gamma = 2$ is illustrative; no claim about physical scales

### What Would Strengthen This Toy

- Multiple witness layers ($W_m$ intermediate) to define witness depth $k$ explicitly
- Defect composition rules to make quadratic drift literal
- Formal proof that no other stable behavior exists for this token set

These are addressed in **𝕌₁₀** and **𝕌₁₂**.

## K. Collapse-Gate Audit

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| No time primitive | ✅ Pass (extension depth only) |
| No dynamics | ✅ Pass |
| No probability primitive | ✅ Pass |
| No objects presupposed | ✅ Pass |
| No semantics | ✅ Pass |
| PASS respected | ✅ Pass (defect-only coupling) |
| Witness-invisibility of 9th coordinate | ✅ Pass (not used in toy) |

**Audit Result:** ✅ Clean (as existence proof)

## L. Forward License from This Toy

- Claim that all NFC systems behave this way
- Physical interpretation without explicit mapping
- Derivation of Born rule or specific probabilities
